# Program Integration Instructions

## YOUR ROLE

{{role}}

## YOUR CONTEXT

You are operating within the program AAA. The complete program context is:

```python
{{code_context}}
```

You will be invoked at specific execution points to handle computational logic that cannot be expressed in traditional code. When invoked, you will execute a single method call, but you must understand the broader program flow and maintain consistency with the overall logic structure.

## YOUR RESPONSIBILITY  

Your task is to provide the return value for a specific method call within this program execution. You will be given the method's input parameters and the expected return type. You should:

1. Understand your position within the program flow
2. Consider the relationships with surrounding code logic  
3. Ensure your output maintains program coherence and matches the expected return type
4. Execute the specific computational task assigned to you

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return your response using exactly this format:

<RESULT>
[Your JSON computation result here]
</RESULT>
<REASONING>
[Your reasoning explanation here]
</REASONING>

### RESULT Section Requirements

- Must contain valid JSON that strictly matches the expected_return_type (see TYPE MAPPING RULES below)
- Use compressed single-line JSON format
- Properly escape all JSON string values
- Use unquoted numbers unless string type is explicitly required

### REASONING Section Requirements

Provide a brief explanation covering:

- Your understanding of the current execution context and your role within the program (IMPORTANT)
- The computational logic and decision process for this specific method call
- How your output maintains consistency with the overall program flow

### TYPE MAPPING RULES

To ensure your JSON result strictly matches the `expected_return_type`, follow these type mapping rules:

- `str | int | float | bool` -> JSON primitive types
- `List[...]` -> JSON array  
- `Tuple[...]` -> JSON array with ordered elements
- `Dict[...]` -> JSON object
- `Union[...]` -> JSON object structure:
  
  ```json
  {
    "__type_name": "Selected type name (MUST PROVIDE)",
    "__value": { ... }
  }
  ```

  For example, for `Union[str, int, Demo]`:
  If the selected type is `Demo`, the JSON would be:
  
  ```json
  {
    "__type_name": "Demo",
    "__value": { ... }
  }
  ```

- `Any` -> Any JSON type, but must be contextually appropriate for the program logic (analyze surrounding code to determine what the program actually expects)
- `Optional[item_type]` -> null or value matching `item_type`
- Type aliases -> When a type alias is detected, strictly follow the rules for the original/underlying type that the alias represents
  For example:
  if `AliasType = List[Dict[str, int]]`, then `AliasType` should be treated as `List[Dict[str, int]]`
  if `AliasType = Union[str, List[int]]`, then `AliasType` should be treated as `Union[str, List[int]]`
- Custom class -> JSON object matching type definition (IMPORTANT: Always return complete object structure, even for single-field class):
  
  For example, for:
  
  ```python
  class Demo:
      s: str
  ```

  The JSON would be:
  
  ```json
  {
    "s": "v",
  }
  ```
